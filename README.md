### Target Process

* _tp_group_projects.user.js_: A greasemonkey style user script to highlight assignables, grouped by project, in the Target Process Time Sheet view.

### Scripts\VisualStudio
* CleanBuildArtifacts.bat: Remove everything but source/project/configuration/etc... files from a solution directory to get rid of generated binaries, intermediate object files and whatnot.  I think this was originally borrowed from the MVVMLight source tree.

* Vs_RenameByNs.ps1: Search and replace for a string within a solution directory (fine names and contents).  Useful for taking project level scaffolding and quickly refactoring the names to start a new project.
